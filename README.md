# Attention and Talker-Specificity in the Memory Encoding of Spoken Sentences

This repository contains all materials required to run the three experiments included in the manuscript *Attention and Talker-Specificity in the Memory Encoding of Spoken Sentences* (William Clapp \& Meghan Sumner, 2024).

Experiment 1 is a study/test recognition memory experiment with spoken sentences heard in both blocks. Experiment 2 is a cross-modal recognition memory experiment with spoken sentences at study and written sentences at test. Experiment 3 is a cross-modal recognition memory experiment with spoken sentences at study and images at test. All three experiments include between-subjects divided and full attention conditions.
